A small game built in java from scratch

Right now there are unicorns, poo things, shooting does something, its 15x easier to make maps
There is no real point of the game just walk around and kill all the things and that's it :)

You will find the jar file in exports/export_2

Controls
WASD - movement
point and click - shoot
P - super fast mode(hold down)
